The to-do list was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure included a heading, an input field for tasks, an "Add Task" button, and a task display area. CSS styling provided a neat layout with checkboxes and delete buttons for tasks. The JavaScript logic focused on interactions and local storage management. Adding a task involved input validation and updating the UI and local storage. Task deletion and completion were handled similarly, adjusting both UI and local storage accordingly. Local storage ensured task persistence between page reloads. Overall, the approach was to maintain simplicity and modularity for smooth user experience and easy future extensions.
